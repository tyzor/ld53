 - Figure out best way to do physics
    - probably fix table on xz axis and lock the ball to that plane
    - apply a fake downward force that makes the ball always move towards bottom of table
    - ramps should be defined by curves and once the ball enters the start of a ramp it gets "sucked" into the path until it's released

table elements
    - spinning DK barrels to select direction
    - targets will be rockets that take off

- upgrades after x amount of deliveries

- animations for bounce collisions on slings/bumpers
