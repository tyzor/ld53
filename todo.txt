HIGH PRIORITY
- reset table + increase difficulty
- max velocity on ball



- upgrades after x amount of deliveries

- animations for bounce collisions on slings/bumpers


Current Idea for Theme: Hungry Cats!
- you have to deliver kibble balls to the cats at the top
- putting wrong color will cause them to spit it back out faster
- cat hunger meter will continue to go down if they are not fed


===BUGS===
Ball may get stuck in places -- need to add a check in Ball.cs to jostle it if it hasn't moved



=== QUESTIONS ===
What is the proper way to handle state machines with timers between transitions?
